# Chess Board

## [Latest open pull request]()

## Description

Used Jupyter notebook, along with MatplotLib and Numpy libraries to simulate a chess board. This also included simulating having two queens, and a class representing the board should be able to check if a queen (red) is under attack by the other one (blue).
